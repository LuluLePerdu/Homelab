# Homelab
So, I am writing this to share my current setup after tinkering during my year-end break as a way to document what I did for myself and for others who may be interested. Also, with this, I will have a record of what I did during this moment in time to look back on in the future.
I'm a bit stupid and I'll probably forget how I made some config, it leaves me at least a backup I guess ?
